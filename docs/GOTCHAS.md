# GOTCHAS — media stack (petedio-media-iac)

Media-specific hard-won patterns. The general Terraform / bpg-proxmox / Ansible
gotchas live in **`petedio-iac`'s `docs/GOTCHAS.md`** and apply here too — they're
summarized in `CLAUDE.md`. This file adds what's special about the media capture.

## Brownfield import

- **Import is state-only — it never touches the live container.** The whole job is
  to make HCL describe reality so `plan` is a clean no-op. Prove zero-drift on
  `plan` BEFORE any `apply`. An apply against drift could mutate or recreate a
  data-heavy media LXC (Plex library, *arr configs) — unacceptable.
- **Keep the live legacy VMIDs.** A Proxmox VMID is fixed at creation; "renumbering"
  to the 21x scheme means destroy+recreate. Deferred (PET-49). Import at 100/101/
  103/104/105/109/110.
- **The inventory doc drifted from reality** (corrected 2026-06-04): it mislabeled
  VMID→role→IP and omitted lidarr/seerr/filebrowser. Always `pct list`/`pct config`
  on pve01 before trusting any inventory.

## Per-host shape (the variances that bite)

- **rootfs datastore varies:** most media LXCs are on `local-lvm`, but **seerr
  (101), sonarr (104), radarr (105) are on `sdb3-storage`**. The module's
  `datastore_id` must match per host or plan shows drift.
- **plex (103) is DUAL-HOMED:** net0 = vmbr0 `192.168.86.140` (mesh, gw .86.1),
  net1 = vmbr1 `192.168.50.140` (LAN). The module's `net1_*` vars add the second
  NIC. Its `/downloads` bind-mount is **read-only** (`ro=1`).
- **seerr (101) is odd:** its only NIC is **eth1** (not eth0), firewall on, and it
  has **no bind-mounts**. Capture exactly that — don't assume eth0.
- **Bind-mount target paths differ per container:** `/mnt/media` vs `/media`,
  `/downloads` vs `/mnt/downloads`. They're host-dir bind-mounts of the shared
  `/mnt/media` + `/mnt/downloads` on pve01. Encode each host's actual target path.
- **Firewall flag:** on for plex, seerr, qbittorrent-vpn; off for the rest.

## qbittorrent-vpn — two states

- **110 is also managed by the OLD homelab-infra TF.** Capturing it here means two
  states could manage one container. Before applying anything: `terraform state rm`
  it from the OLD side (or retire the old stack). Don't touch old state casually —
  flag and coordinate.
- **VPN secrets go to Vault, not code.** Proton WireGuard key + qBit password →
  a media Vault path (e.g. `kv/services/media/qbittorrent`), read by a media-scoped
  policy. Never commit them; never widen the shared `ansible` policy to reach them.

## State / secrets isolation

- This repo uses the **same MinIO** (`.221`) but a **separate state key**
  (`media/terraform.tfstate`) — isolated from petedio-iac's `homelab/...` state.
- Proxmox token + MinIO creds + the LXC ssh key are the **same** Vault values
  petedio-iac uses (`kv/iac/proxmox`, `kv/iac/minio`, `kv/iac/lxc-ssh`). Media-
  SPECIFIC secrets (the VPN creds) are the only net-new Vault material.
