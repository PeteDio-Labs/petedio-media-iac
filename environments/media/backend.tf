# State lives in the same FRESH MinIO as petedio-iac (LXC 221 / .221, bucket
# `tfstate`, versioning on) but under a SEPARATE key — `media/terraform.tfstate`
# — so the media stack's state is isolated from petedio-iac's homelab state.
#
# Locking is NOT implemented (MinIO doesn't speak DynamoDB). Single operator;
# bucket versioning is the safety net. Never run concurrent applies (local + CI).
#
# Credentials come from env vars AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID / AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
# (locally) or the runner's Vault-OIDC step in CI. Never put them inline here.
